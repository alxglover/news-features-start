Using the Features Module to Import and Display Content

Description:
This session will walk through the workflow of pulling content from the web
and displaying it on your website. We will review how to use the Features
module to wrap your code into a shareable module. The end process will
involve:

* creating a custom content type to store your data
* using the Feeds module to pull XML from a news feed via cron or an import page
* storing the news feed in your custom content type
* tagging news items with taxonomy for various display purposes
* displaying the news feeds on your web site

To get started:

* Create a "features-demo" folder that will hold your files for this demo.
* In terminal, go to that folder.
* Run this command:
** git clone git@github.com:ebanford/news-features-start.git
* This will create a news-features-start folder with your starting files.
* Open the PowerPoint file FeedsDemoPresentation.pptx
* Follow the demo.

* As you go, your file system should look like this:
* features-demo
** docroot   - this is a renamed copy of Drupal 7
** news-features-start   - this is files from this repository

Good luck, I hope this demo is helpful.
